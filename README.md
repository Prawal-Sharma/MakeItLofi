# Make It Lo-Fi üéµ

Transform your audio into authentic lo-fi with vintage textures and analog warmth. A web application that takes audio files and applies professional lo-fi processing using advanced DSP techniques and real texture samples.

## What is Make It Lo-Fi?

Make It Lo-Fi is a web-based audio processing tool that transforms modern, clean audio into nostalgic lo-fi tracks. It simulates the characteristics of vintage recording equipment, adding warmth, texture, and character that defines the lo-fi aesthetic. Perfect for content creators, musicians, or anyone who loves the cozy, nostalgic sound of lo-fi.

## Architecture

                                  (Job Status)
```

### Direct Upload Architecture (New!)
- Client uploads directly to Vercel Blob (supports 500MB files)
- Only blob URLs sent to API (bypasses 4.5MB function limit)
- Lambda downloads from blob for processing
- Processed files stored back in blob storage

## Lo-Fi Presets

### üéß Default
Balanced lo-fi effect with moderate processing

### üìº Tape 90s
Warmer sound with more saturation, mimicking 90s cassette tapes

### üò¥ Sleep
Slower, dreamier with more reverb for relaxation

## Technical Audio Processing Details

### DSP Chain Implementation

Our lo-fi processing uses sophisticated FFmpeg filter chains customized per preset:

#### Core Effects (All Presets)
- **Tempo Reduction**: 88-95% speed for that lazy feel
- **Pitch Shifting**: Down 1-3 semitones for warmth
- **EQ Filtering**: 
  - High-pass to remove rumble
  - Low-pass (8-12kHz) for vintage character
  - Mid-frequency adjustments for body
- **Compression**: Gentle dynamics control
- **Stereo Processing**: Narrowed field for vintage mono-ish sound

#### Texture Layers
Real audio textures mixed at different levels:
- **Vinyl Crackle**: Authentic record player sounds
- **Tape Hiss**: Analog tape characteristics
- **Rain Ambient**: Atmospheric background

#### Analog Simulation
- **Wow/Flutter**: Pitch instability of tape
- **Saturation**: Soft clipping for warmth
- **Echo/Reverb**: Spatial dimension
- **Sidechain Compression**: Subtle pumping effect

## API Documentation

### Create Processing Job
```http
POST /api/jobs
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "blobUrl": "https://...",
  "fileName": "song.mp3",
  "preset": "default" | "tape90s" | "sleep"
}
```

### Check Job Status
```http
GET /api/jobs/:jobId

```bash
npm run build
npm run package
```

3. Deploy to AWS:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run start      # Start production server
npm run lint       # Lint code
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript checking
```

## Security Features

- ‚úÖ Direct client-side uploads (no server bottleneck)
- ‚úÖ Path traversal protection
- ‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization
- ‚úÖ File type verification
- ‚úÖ Secure cloud storage
- ‚úÖ Automatic file cleanup

## Performance Features

- ‚ö° Serverless architecture (infinite scale)
- ‚ö° Direct uploads (bypasses function limits)
- ‚ö° Streaming processing (memory efficient)
- ‚ö° SQS queue with retry logic
- ‚ö° DynamoDB for fast status updates
- ‚ö° CDN-served processed files

## File Size Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 500MB (Vercel Blob limit)
- **Recommended**: Under 100MB for faster processing
- **All common audio formats supported**: WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, AAC

## Troubleshooting

### Large files failing?
The app now supports files up to 500MB through direct upload. If you experience issues:
- Check your internet connection stability
- Try a smaller file first
- Ensure the file isn't corrupted

### Processing taking too long?
- Normal processing time: 30-60 seconds for a 3-minute song
- Longer files take proportionally more time
- Check the AWS Lambda logs if consistently slow

### No audio output?
- Verify the input file plays correctly
- Check browser console for errors
- Try a different audio format

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)
The frontend auto-deploys from the main branch via Vercel's GitHub integration.

### Backend (AWS Lambda)
Lambda functions are deployed using the AWS CLI. Ensure your AWS credentials are configured.
