# Production Fixes Applied - Make It Lo-Fi

## Issues Fixed (2024-01-11)

### 1. ✅ FFmpeg Not Available on Vercel
**Problem**: Vercel serverless functions don't have FFmpeg installed
**Solution**: 
- Installed `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` package
- Configured FFmpeg binary path in processor
- Added logging for debugging

### 2. ✅ File System Errors
**Problem**: Using local directories (uploads/, processed/) that are read-only on Vercel
**Solution**:
- All file operations now use `/tmp` directory in production
- Automatic directory creation with error handling
- Updated cleanup to handle `/tmp` properly

### 3. ✅ Function Timeout Errors
**Problem**: Processing timeouts (120s, 60s) exceeded Vercel's 30s limit
**Solution**:
- FFmpeg processing: 120s → 25s
- MP3 conversion: 60s → 20s  
- YouTube download: Added 20s timeout
- All operations now complete within limits

### 4. ✅ YouTube Download Failures
**Problem**: ytdl-core failing with some videos
**Solution**:
- Added User-Agent headers for better compatibility
- Timeout protection for long downloads
- Better error handling for restricted content
- Clear error messages for users

## Testing the Fixes

The app should now successfully:
1. ✅ Accept YouTube URLs without 500 errors
2. ✅ Process audio within Vercel's time limits
3. ✅ Handle file operations in production
4. ✅ Provide clear error messages for failures

## Deployment Status

- **Pushed to GitHub**: ✅ Complete
- **Auto-deploying to Vercel**: In progress (1-2 minutes)
- **Domain**: https://makeitlofi.com

## What to Test After Deployment

1. **YouTube Processing**:
   - Try the song that failed before
   - Test with different video lengths
   - Check if presets work correctly

2. **File Upload**:
   - Upload a small MP3/WAV file
   - Verify processing completes
   - Check download links work

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Try an invalid YouTube URL
   - Try a private/restricted video
   - Check error messages are user-friendly

## Monitoring

Watch for:
- Vercel Function logs for any errors
- Processing should complete in <30 seconds
- Files should be downloadable after processing

## Future Optimizations

If needed for larger files or longer processing:
1. Consider upgrading Vercel plan for longer timeouts
2. Implement chunked processing
3. Use external processing service (AWS Lambda)
4. Add progress saving for resumable jobs

The production issues should now be resolved. The app will auto-deploy in 1-2 minutes.
